# TensorGame

A browser-based game to learn working with Torch tensors.

## Your task

In each level, you are shown an input tensor and a target tensor.

You have one line of Python to transform the input into the target.


## Tech and design principles

Python is run in the browser using [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/#).

As much of the game logic is implemented in Python, with as little JS and HTML
as possible.
